1. Users can enter a lottery with ETH based on a USD fee.
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over (Enhancement: Could replace with a DAO or automated timeframe).
3. The lottery will select a random winner.

How do we want to test this?

1. 'mainnet-fork'
2. 'development' with mocks
3. 'testnet'
